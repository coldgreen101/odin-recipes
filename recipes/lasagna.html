    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Look, I'm not gonna lie – this lasagna is a bit of work. But trust me,
      it's so worth it. We're talking ooey-gooey cheese, rich meat sauce, and
      pasta that'll make your taste buds dance. It's the kind of comfort food
      that'll have you coming back for seconds (or thirds, no judgment here).
      Whip this up for your next family dinner and watch it disappear. Pro tip:
      it freezes like a dream, so future-you can thank present-you later.
      Seriously, give it a shot – your stomach will thank you!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian
        sausage <em>and</em> lean ground beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are
        cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes,
        two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle
        sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored
        with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel
        seeds, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna
        noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make
        this lasagna extra decadent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze
        out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <li><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
        heat until well browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season
        with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian
        seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1
        <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hours, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
        noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
        with cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
        tablespoons parsley, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon salt.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        To assemble, spread 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups of meat sauce
        in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise
        over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with
        <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with
        <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the mozarella cheese slices. Spoon 1
        <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups meat sauce over mozarella, and
        sprinkle with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozarella and Parmesan cheese.
        Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
        spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for
        an additional 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
